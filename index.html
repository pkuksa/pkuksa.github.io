<p>
I am an associate fellow in the <a href="http://ibi.upenn.edu/">Institute for Biomedical Informatics</a> at the University of Pennsylvania and a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of
Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Previously, I was a postdoctoral scientist at <a href="http://www.nec-labs.com/">NEC Laboratories America, Inc.</a>
in the <a href="http://www.nec-labs.com/research-departments/machine-learning/machine-learning-home">Machine Learning department</a>.
Before that, I was working on my Ph.D. at the <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu">Department of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://rutgers.edu">Rutgers University</a>, where I was affiliated with 
<a href="http://seqam.rutgers.edu/site/">Rutgers Sequence Analysis and Modeling Lab (SeqAM)</a>.
My main research interests include applied machine learning, sequence modeling and analysis, biomedical informatics, natural language processing, algorithms, pattern recognition, text and data mining, and computer vision.
I got bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering (2002) and M.Sc. in Information and Computer Sciences (2004) from <a href="http://www.bmstu.ru/en/general-information/about-bmstu/" target="_blank">Bauman Moscow State Technical University</a> (Moscow, Russia).
